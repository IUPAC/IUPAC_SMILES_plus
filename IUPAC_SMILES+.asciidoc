== Introduction

****
"... we cannot improve the language of any science, without, at the
same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other
hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature
which belongs to it ..."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier[Antoine Lavoiser, 1787]
****

=== Purpose

This document formally defines an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_specifications[open specification] version of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification[SMILES]
language, a typographical http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_notation[line notation]
for specifying chemical structure. It is hosted under the banner of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Obelisk[Blue Obelisk]
project, with the intent to solicit contributions and comments from the
entire computational chemistry community.

=== Motivation


SMILES was originally developed as a proprietary specification by
http://www.daylight.com[Daylight Chemical Information Systems]
Since the introduction of SMILES in the late 1980's, it has
become widely accepted as a defacto standard for exchange of molecular structures.  Many independent
SMILES software packages have been written in `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `LISP`, and probably even
`FORTRAN`.

At this point in the history of SMILES, it is appropriate for the chemistry community
to develop a new, non-proprietary specification for the SMILES language.  Daylight's
http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html[SMILES Theory Manual]
has long been the "gold standard" for the SMILES language, but as a
proprietary specification, it limits the universal adoption of SMILES, and has no
mechanism for contributions from the chemistry community.  We salute Daylight for
their past contributions, and the excellent SMILES documentation they provided free
of charge for the past two decades.

=== Audience

This document is intended for developers designing or improving a SMILES
parser or writer. **Readers are expected to be acquainted with
SMILES.** Due to the formality of this document, it is not a good
tutorial for those trying to learn SMILES. This document is written with
*precision* as the primary goal; *readability* is secondary.

=== What is a Molecule? The Valence Model of Chemistry

Before defining the SMILES language, it is important to state the physical model on which it is
based: the valence model of chemistry, which uses a mathematician's
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory[graph] to
represent a molecule.  In a chemical graph, the *nodes*
are atoms, and the *edges* are semi-rigid bonds that can be single, double, or
triple according to the rules of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_bond_theory[valence bond theory].

This simple mental model has little resemblance to the underlying quantum-mechanical reality of
electrons, protons and neutrons, yet it has proved to be a remarkably useful approximation of how
atoms behave in close proximity to one another.  However, the valence model is an imperfect
representation of molecular structure, and the SMILES language inherits these imperfections.
Chemical bonds are often tautomeric, aromatic or otherwise fractional rather than neat integer
multiples.  Delocalized bonds, bond-centered bonds, hydrogen bonds and various other inter-atom
forces that are well characterized by a quantum-mechanics description simply don't fit into the
valence model.

****
"If you can build a molecule from a modeling kit, you can name it."

http://www.daylight.com/meetings/mug03/McLeod/MUG03McLeodPeters.pdf[McLeod Peters]
****

McLeod and Peters' quip captures the deficiencies of SMILES well: if you
*can't* build a molecule from a modeling kit, the deficiencies of SMILES and other
connection-table formats become apparent.

== Formal Grammar

=== Syntax versus Semantics

This SMILES specification is divided into two distinct parts: A
*syntactic specification* specifies how the atoms,
bonds, parentheses, digits and so forth are represented, and a *semantic
specification* that describes how those symbols are interpreted as a sensible
molecule.  For example, the syntax specifies how <<ringclosure,ring closures>>
are written, but the semantics require that they come in pairs.
Likewise, the syntax specifies how <<atomicsymbol,atomic elements>>
are written, but the semantics determines whether a particular ring system
is actually aromatic.

For this specification, the syntax and semantics are explained
separately; in practice, the syntax and semantics are usually mixed
together in the code that implements a SMILES parser.  This chapter is only
concerned with syntax.

== Reading SMILES

[[inatoms]]

=== Atoms

[[atomicsymbol]]

==== Atomic Symbol

An atom is represented by its atomic symbol, enclosed in square brackets, `[]`.
The first character of the symbol is uppercase and the second (if any) is lowercase,
except that for aromatic atoms (see below), the first character is lowercase.  There are https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/[118 valid atomic symbols] as defined by https://iupac.org/[IUPAC].

The symbol `'*'` is also accepted as a valid atomic symbol, and represents a "wildcard" or unknown atom.

Examples:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="30%",cols="1,2"]
|============================
| SMILES      | Atomic Symbol
| `[U]`       | Uranium
| `[Pb]`      | Lead
| `[He]`      | Helium
| `[*]`       | Unkwown atom
|============================

[[hydrogens]]

==== Hydrogens

Hydrogens inside of brackets are specified as `Hn` where `n` is a number such as `H3`.  If no
`Hn` is specified, it is identical to `H0`. If `H` is
specified without a number, it is identical to `H1`.  For example, `[C]` and
`[CH0]` are identical, and `[CH]` and `[CH1]` are identical.

Hydrogens that are specified in brackets with this notation have undefined isotope, no chirality,
no other bound hydrogen, neutral charge, and an undefined atom class.

Examples:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="50%",cols="1,2,2"]
|=================================================
| SMILES    | Name                  | Comments
| `[CH4]`   | methane               |
| `[ClH]`   | hydrochloric acid     | `H1` implied
| `[ClH1]`  | hydrochloric acid     |
|=================================================

A hydrogen atom cannot have a hydrogen count, for example, `[HH1]` is illegal.  Hydrogens connected
to other hydrogens must be represented as explicit atoms in square brackets. For example molecular
hydrogen must be written as `[H][H]`.

_Question: are more than 9 hydrogens possible?  Should they be
supported?_

[[charge]]

==== Charge

Charge is specified by a `+n` or `-n` where `n` is a number; if the
number is missing, it means either `+1` or `-1` as appropriate.

For backwards compatibility, a general-purpose SMILES parser should
accept the symbols `--` and `++` to mean charges of `-2` and `+2`, but this
is a deprecated form and should be avoided.

Examples:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="60%",cols="1,2,3"]
|==============================================================
| SMILES    | Name                  | Comments
| `[Cl-]`   | chloride anion        | `-1` charge, `H0` implied
| `[OH1-]`  | hydroxyl anion        | `-1` charge, `H1`
| `[OH-1]`  | hydroxyl anion        | `-1` charge, `H1`
| `[Cu+2]`  | copper cation         | `+2` charge, `H0` implied
| `[Cu++]`  | copper cation         | `+2` charge, `H0` implied
|==============================================================

An implementation is required to accept charges in the range `-15` to `+15`.

==== Isotopes

Isotopic specification is placed inside the square brackets for an atom
preceding the atomic symbol; for example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%"]
|=============================
| SMILES    | Atomic Symbol
| `[13CH4]` | methane
| `[2H+]`   | deuterium ion
| `[238U]`  | Uranium 238 atom
|=============================

An isotope is interpreted as a number, so that `[2H]`,
`[02H]` and `[002H]` all mean deuterium.  If the isotope field
is not specified then the atom is assumed to have the naturally-occurring isotopic ratios.  The
isotope value 0 also indicates an isotope of zero, that is
`[0S]` is *not* the same as `[S]`.

There is no requirement that the isotope is a genuine isotope of the element.  Thus,
`[36Cl]` is allowed even though ^35^Cl and
^37^Cl are the actual known stable isotopes of chlorine.

A general-purpose SMILES parser must accept at least three digits for the isotope and values
from 0 to 999.

[[orgsbst]]

==== Organic Subset

A special subset of elements called the "organic subset" of
**B**, **C**, **N**, **O**, **P**, **S**, **F**,
**Cl**, **Br**, **I**, and ***** (the "wildcard" atom) can be
written using the only the atomic symbol (that is, without the square
brackets, H-count, etc.).  An atom is specified this way has the
following properties:

* "implicit hydrogens" are added such that valence of the atom is in
  the lowest normal state for that element
* the atom's charge is zero
* the atom has no isotopic specification
* the atom has no chiral specification

The implicit hydrogen count is determined by summing the bond orders
of the bonds connected to the atom.  If that sum is equal to a known
valence for the element or is greater than any known valence then the
implicit hydrogen count is 0.  Otherwise the implicit hydrogen count is the
difference between that sum and the next highest known valence.

The "normal valence" for these elements is defined as:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="30%"]
|============================
| Element       | Valence
| B             | 3
| C             | 4
| N             | 3 or 5
| O             | 2
| P             | 3 or 5
| S             | 2, 4 or 6
| halogens      | 1
| *             | unspecified
|============================

Examples:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="30%",cols="1,3"]
|==============================
| SMILES    | Name
| `C`       | methane
| `N`       | ammonia
| `Cl`      | hydrochloric acid
|==============================

_Note: The remaining atom properties, chirality and ring-closures, are discussed in later sections._

==== The Wildcard `'*'` Atomic Symbol

The `'*'` atom represents an atom whose atomic number is unknown or unspecified.  If it occurs
inside brackets, it can have its isotope, chirality, hydrogen count and charge specified.  If it
occurs outside of brackets, it has no assumed isotope, a mass of zero, unspecified chirality, a
hydrogen count of zero, and a charge of zero.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%",cols="2,3"]
|==============================================
| SMILES              | Name
| `Oc1c(*)cccc1`      | ortho-substituted phenol
|==============================================

The `'*'` atom does not have any specific electronic properties or
valence.  If specified outside of square brackets, it takes on the valence
implied by its bonds.  If it is inside square brackets, it takes on the
valence implied by its bonds, hydrogens and/or charge.

A `'*'` atom can be part of an aromatic ring.  When deducing the
aromaticity of a ring system, the ring system is considered aromatic if
there is an element which could replace the `'*'` and make the ring system
meet the aromaticity rules (see <<inaromaticity,Aromaticity>>, below).

[[atomclass]]

==== Atom Class

An "atom class" is an arbitrary integer, a number that has no chemical
meaning.  It is used by applications to mark atoms in ways that are
meaningful only to the application.  Multiple atoms may be labeled with the
same atom class.

The atom class is specified after all other properties in square brackets. For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%",cols="1,3"]
|========================================
| SMILES     | Name
| `[CH4:2]`  | methane, atom's class is 2
|========================================

If the atom class is not specified then the atom class is zero.
The atom class is interpreted as a number, so both `[CH2:5]`
and `[NH4+:005]` have an atom class of 5.

[[bonds]]

=== Bonds

Atoms that are adjacent in a SMILES string are assumed to
be joined by a single or aromatic bond (see <<inaromaticity,Aromaticity>>). For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="30%"]
|===================================
| SMILES              | Name
| `CC`                | ethane
| `CCO`               | ethanol
| `NCCCC`             | n-butylamine
| `CCCCN`             | n-butylamine
|===================================

Double, triple and quadruple bonds are represented by `'='`, `'#'`, and `'$'` respectively:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="80%",cols="2,1"]
|========================================================================
| SMILES                                      | Name
| `C=C`                                       | ethene
| `C#N`                                       | hydrogen cyanide
| `CC#CC`                                     | 2-butyne
| `CCC=O`                                     | propanol
| `[Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)$[Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl` | octachlorodirhenate (III)
|========================================================================

A single bond can be explicitely represented with `'-'`, but it is rarely
necessary.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%"]
|===================================
| SMILES          |
| `C-C`           | same as: `CC`
| `C-C-O`         | same as: `CCO`
| `C-C=C-C`       | same as: `CC=CC`
|===================================

Note: The remaining bond symbols, `':\/'`, are discussed in
later sections.

=== Branches

An atom with three or more bonds is called a *branched atom*, and is
represented using parentheses.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|============================================================================
| Depiction                                 | SMILES      | Name
| image:depict/2-ethyl-1-butanol.gif[]      | `CCC(CC)CO` | 2-ethyl-1-butanol
|============================================================================

Branches can be nested or "stacked" to any depth:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|============================================================================================================
| Depiction                                   | SMILES                      | Name

| image:depict/thiosulfate.gif[]              | `OS(=O)(=S)O`               | thiosulfate
|============================================================================================================

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

The SMILES branch/chain rules allow nested parenthetical expressions (branches) to an arbitrary
depth. For example, the following SMILES, though peculiar, is legal:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%",cols="6,1"]
|==============================================================================
| SMILES                                                              | Formula
| `C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C\(C))))))))))))))))))))C`    | C22H46
|==============================================================================

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

[[ringclosure]]

=== Rings

In a SMILES string such as "C1CCCCC1", the first occurrence of a ring-closure
number (an "rnum") creates an "open bond" to the atom that precedes the
ring-closure number (the "rnum").  When that same rnum is encountered
later in the string, a bond is made between the two atoms, which typically
forms a cyclic structure.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|==================================================================================
| Depiction                               | SMILES           | Name
| image:depict/cyclohexane.gif[]          | `C1CCCCC1`       | cyclohexane
| image:depict/perhydroisoquinoline.gif[] | `N1CC2CCCCC2CC1`  | perhydroisoquinoline
|==================================================================================

If a bond symbol is present between the atom and rnum, it can be
present on *either or both* bonded atoms.  However, if it appears on
both bonded atoms, the two bond symbols must be the same.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|=================================================================================================
| Depiction                                     | SMILES          | Name
.4+| image:depict/cyclohexene.gif[]             | `C=1CCCCC=1`    | cyclohexene
|                                                 `C=1CCCCC1`     | cyclohexene *(preferred form)*
|                                                 `C1CCCCC=1`     | cyclohexene
|                                                 `C-1CCCCC=1`    | *invalid*
|=================================================================================================

Ring closures must be matched pairs in a SMILES string, for example, `C1CCC`
is not a valid SMILES.

It is permissible to re-use ring-closure numbers.  Once a particular number
has been encountered twice, that number is available again for subsequent ring closures.

Note that the ring number zero is valid, for example cyclohexane can be
written `C0CCCCC0`.

Two-digit ring numbers are permitted, but must be preceded by the percent
`'%'` symbol, such as `C%25CCCCC%25` for cyclohexane. Three-digit numbers and
larger are never permitted.  However, note that three digits are not invalid; for
example, `C%123` is the same as `C3%12`, that is, an atom with two rnum
specifications.

The digit(s) representing a ring-closure are interpreted as a number, not a
symbol, and two rnums match if their numbers match.  Thus, `C1CCCCC%01` is a
valid SMILES and is the same as `C1CCCCC1`.  Likewise, `C%00CCCCC%00` is a
valid SMILES.

A single atom can have several ring-closure numbers, such as this spiro
atom:

[[inaromaticity]]

=== Aromaticity

==== The Meaning of "Aromaticity" in SMILES

"Aromaticity" in SMILES is primarily for
https://www.emolecules.com/info/support-cheminformatics-101.html#/cheminformatics-basics[cheminformatics] purposes.
In a cheminformatics system, we'd like to have a single representation for each molecule.  The
Kekule form masks the inherent uniformity of the bonds in an aromatic ring.  SMILES uses a
simplified definition of aromaticity that facilitates substructure and exact-structure
searches, as well as <<normalization,Normalization>> and <<canonicalization,Canonicalization>> of SMILES.

The definition of "aromaticity" in SMILES is *not* intended to imply anything about the
physical or chemical properties of a substance.  In many or most cases, the SMILES definition of
aromaticity will match the chemist's notion of what is aromatic, but in some cases it will not.

==== Kekule and Aromatic Representations

Aromaticity can be represented in one of two ways in a SMILES.

* In the Kekule form, using alternating single and double bonds, with
  uppercase symbols for the atoms.
* An atomic symbol that begins with a lowercase letter is an aromatic atom, such as `'c'`
  for aromatic carbon.  When aromatic symbols are used, no bond symbols are needed.

A lowercase aromatic symbol is defined as an atom in the sp^2^ configuration in an
aromatic or anti-aromatic ring system.  For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|=========================================================================================
| Depiction                                 | SMILES                      | Name
.2+| image:depict/benzene.gif[]             | `c1ccccc1`               .2+| benzene
|                                             `C1=CC=CC=C1`
.2+| image:depict/indane.gif[]              | `c1ccc2CCCc2c1`          .2+| indane
|                                             `C1=CC=CC(CCC2)=C12`
.2+| image:depict/furan.gif[]               | `c1occc1`                .2+| furan
|                                             `C1OC=CC=1`
.2+| image:depict/cyclobutadiene.gif[]      | `c1ccc1`                 .2+| cyclobutadiene
|                                             `C1=CC=C1`
|=========================================================================================

The Kekule form is always acceptable for SMILES input.  For output, the aromatic form
(using lowercase letters) <<outaromaticity,is preferred>>.  The lowercase
symbols eliminate the arbitrary choice of how to assign the single and double bonds, and provide a
<<normalization,normalized form>> that more accurately reflects the electronic configuration.

==== Extended Hueckel's Rule

[red]*THIS SECTION IS UNDER MAJOR REVISION, AND AT THIS POINT IS ONLY FOR
DISCUSSION PURPOSES.*

[red]*This proposed section is an attempt to simplify the rule-based
system by enumerating all atom/bond configurations that are known to
participate in aromatic systems.*

A single, isolated ring that meets the following criteria is aromatic:

* All atoms must be sp^2^ hybridized.
* The number of available "shared" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_bond[&#960; electrons]
  must equal 4N+2 where N &ge; 0 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel%27s_rule[Huckel's rule]).

Each element that can participate in an aromatic ring is defined to have the following
number of &#960; electrons:

:valign: middle
:halign: center

|===========================================================================================================================================

==== Aromaticity Algorithm

In an aromatic system, all of the aromatic atoms must be sp^2^ hybridized, and the
number of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_bond[&#960; electrons]
must meet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel%27s_rule[Huckel's 4n+2 criterion]
When parsing a SMILES, a parser must note the aromatic designation of each atom on
input, then when the parsing is complete, the SMILES software must verify that electrons can be
assigned without violating the valence rules, consistent with the sp^2^ markings, the
specified or implied hydrogens, external bonds, and charges on the atoms.

The aromatic-bond symbol `':'` can be used between aromatic atoms, but it is never necessary; a
bond between two aromatic atoms is assumed to be aromatic unless it is explicitly represented as a
single bond `'-'`.  However, a single bond (nonaromatic bond) between two aromatic atoms *must*
be explicitly represented.  For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|================================================================
| Depiction                   | SMILES                 | Name
| image:depict/biphenyl.gif[] | `c1ccccc1-c2ccccc2`   | biphenyl
|================================================================

_Note: Some SMILES parsers interpret a lowercase letter as sp^2^ anywhere it appears;
for example, `CccccC` would be interpreted as `CC=CC=CC`.
The OpenSMILES specification does not allow this interpretation unless
<<nonstandard,nonstandard parsing>> is explicitely allowed by the user._

=== More about Hydrogen

Hydrogens in a SMILES can be represented in three different ways:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="100%",cols="2,2,1,3"]
|======================================================================================================
| Method                | SMILES              | Name          | Comments
| implicit hydrogen     | `C`                 | methane       | h-count deduced from normal valence (4)
| atom property         | `[CH4]`             | methane       | h-count specified for heavy atom
| explicit hydrogen     | `[H]C([H])([H])[H]` | methane       | hydrogens represented as normal atoms
|======================================================================================================

All three forms are equivalent.  However, some situations require that one form must be used:

* Implicit hydrogen count may only be used for elements of the <<orgsbst,organic elements>> subset.
* Any atom that is specified with square brackets *must* have its attached hydrogens
  explicitly represented, either as a hydrogen count or as normal atoms.

A hydrogen that meets one of the following criteria must be represented as an explicit atom:

* hydrogens with charge (`[H+]`)
* a hydrogen connected to another hydrogen (such as molecular hydrogen, `[H][H]`)
* hydrogens with more than one bond (bridging hydrogens)
* Deuterium `[2H]` and tritium `[3H]`

It is permissible to use a mixture of an atom h-count and explicit hydrogen.  In such a case,
the atom's hydrogen count is the sum of the atomic h-count property and the number of attached
hydrogens.  For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%"]
|====================================
| SMILES              | Name
| `[CH4]`             | methane
| `[H][CH2][H]`       | methane
| `[2H][CH2]C`        | deuteroethane
|====================================

=== Disconnected Structures

The dot `'.'` symbol (also called a "dot bond") is legal most places where
a bond symbol would occur, but indicates that the atoms are *not*
bonded.  The most common use of the dot-bond symbol is to represent
disconnected and ionic compounds.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%",cols="2,3,2"]
|============================================================================================================
| Depiction                                     | SMILES                            | Name
| image:depict/sodium-chloride.gif[]            | `[Na+].[Cl-]`                     | sodium chloride
| image:depict/phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif[]     | `Oc1ccccc1.NCCO`                  | phenol, 2-amino ethanol
| image:depict/diammonium-thiosulfate.gif[]     | `[NH4+].[NH4+].[O-]S(=O)(=O)[S-]` | diammonium thiosulfate
|============================================================================================================

The dot can appear most places that a bond symbol is allowed, for example, the phenol example above
can also be written:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|======================================================================================================
| Depiction                                     | SMILES                      | Name
.2+| image:depict/phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif[]  | `c1cc(O.NCCO)ccc1`          | phenol, 2-amino ethanol
|                                                 `Oc1cc(.NCCO)ccc1`          | phenol, 2-amino ethanol
|======================================================================================================

The second example above is an odd, but legal, use of parentheses and the dot bond, since the
syntax allows a dot most places a regular bond could appear (the exception
is that a dot can't appear before a ring-closure digit).

Although dot-bonds are commonly used to represent compounds with disconnected parts, a dot-bond
does *not* in itself mean that there are disconnected parts in the compound.   See the
following section regarding ring digits for some examples that illustrate this.

The dot bond cannot be used in front of a ring-closure digit.  For example, `C.1CCCCC.1` is illegal.

==== Other Uses of Ring Numbers and Dot Bond

A ring-number specifications ("rnum") is most commonly used to specify a ring-closure bond, but
when used with the `'.'` dot-bond symbol, it can also specify a non-ring bond.  Two rnums in a SMILES
mean that the two atoms that precede the rnums are bonded.  A dot-bond `'.'` means that the atoms to
which it is adjacent in the SMILES string are *not* bonded to each other.  By combining these
two constructs, one can "piece together" fragments of SMILES into a whole molecule.  The following
SMILES illustrate this:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%"]
|=========================================================================================================
| SMILES/Depiction                               | Fragment SMILES           | Name
| `CC`                                           | `C1.C1`                   | ethane
| `CCC`                                          | `C1.C12.C2`               | propane
| image:depict/1-bromo-2-3-dichlorobenzene.gif[] | `c1c2c3c4cc1.Br2.Cl3.Cl4` | 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene
|=========================================================================================================

This feature of SMILES provides a convenient method of enumerating the
molecules of a combinatorial library using string concatenation.

[[chirality]]

=== Stereochemistry

==== Scope of Stereochemistry in SMILES

A SMILES string can specify the cis/trans configuration around a double bond,
and can specify the chiral configuration of specific atoms in a molecule.

SMILES strings do *not* represent all types of stereochemistry.  Examples of
stereochemistry that cannot be encoded into a SMILES include:

* Gross conformational left or right handedness such as helices
* Mechanical interferences, such as rotatable bonds that are
  constrained by mechanical interferences
* Gross conformational stereochemistry such as the shape of a protein after folding

==== Tetrahedral Centers

SMILES uses an atom-centered chirality specification, in which the atom's left-to-right order in
the SMILES string itself is used as the basis for the chirality marking.

|=========================================================================

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

For the structure above, starting with the nitrogen atom, one "looks" toward the chiral
center. The remaining three neighbor atoms are written by listing them in anticlockwise order using the `'@'`
chiral property on the atom, or in clockwise order using the `'@@'` chiral property, as illustrated
above.  The `'@'` symbol is a "visual mnemonic" in that the spiral around the character goes in the
anticlockwise direction, and means "anticlockwise" in the SMILES string (thus, `'@@'` can be thought of
as anti-anti-clockwise).

A chiral center can be written starting anywhere in the SMILES string, and the choice of
whether to list the remaining neighbor in clockwise or anticlockwise order is also arbitrary. The
following SMILES are all equivalent and all specify the exact same chiral center illustrated above:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="50%"]
|========================================
| Equivalent SMILES  |
| `N[C@](Br)(O)C`    | `Br[C@](O)(N)C`
| `O[C@](Br)\(C)N`    | `Br[C@]\(C)(O)N`
| `C[C@](Br)(N)O`    | `Br[C@](N)\(C)O`
| `C[C@@](Br)(O)N`   | `Br[C@@](N)(O)C`
| `[C@@]\(C)(Br)(O)N` | `[C@@](Br)(N)(O)C`
|========================================

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

One exception to the atom order is when these atoms are bonded to the chiral center via a
ring bond. In these cases, it is to order of the bonds to these atoms that should be considered.
The two SMILES below are equivalent:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="50%"]
|=========================
| Equivalent SMILES      |
| `FC1C[C@](Br)(Cl)CCC1` | `[C@]1(Br)(Cl)CCCC(F)C1`
|=========================

If one of the neighbor atoms is a hydrogen and is represented as an atomic property of the
chiral center (rather than explicitly as `[H]`), then it is considered to be the first atom in the
clockwise or anticlockwise accounting.  For example, if we replaced the bromine in the illustration
above with a hydrogen atom, its SMILES would be:

==== Cis/Trans configuration of Double Bonds

The configuration of atoms around double bonds is specified by the bond symbols `'/'` and `'\'`.
These symbols always come in pairs, and indicate cis or trans with a visual "same side" or
"opposite side" concept.  That is:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="90%",cols="2,1,4"]
|=========================================================================================================================
| Depiction                                     | SMILES            | Name
.2+| image:depict/trans-difluoroethene.gif[]    | `F/C=C/F`      .2+| trans-difluoroethane *(both SMILES are equivalent)*
|                                                 `F\C=C\F`
.2+| image:depict/cis-difluoroethene.gif[]      | `F\C=C/F`      .2+| cis-difluoroethane *(both SMILES are equivalent)*
|                                                 `F/C=C\F`
|=========================================================================================================================

The "visual interpretation" of the `'/'` and `'\'` symbol is that they are thought of as bonds that
"point" above or below the alkene bond.  That is, `F/C=C/Br` means "The `F` is below the first carbon,
and the `Br` is above the second carbon," leading to the interpretation of a trans configuration.

This notation can be confusing when parentheses follow one of the alkene carbons:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%"]
|===========================================
| SMILES              | Name
| `F/C=C/F`        .2+| trans-difluoroethane
| `C(\F)=C/F`
| `F\C=C/F`        .2+| cis-difluoroethane
| `C(/F)=C/F`
|===========================================

The "visual interpretation" of the "up-ness" or "down-ness" of each single
bond is *relative to the carbon atom*, not the double bond, so the sense of the symbol changes
when the fluorine atom moved from the left to the right side of the alkene carbon atom.

_Note: This point was not well documented in earlier SMILES specifications, and several SMILES
interpreters are known to interpret the `'/'` and `'\'` symbols incorrectly._

A SMILES with conflicting up/down specifications is invalid:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="70%",cols="1,3"]
|=============================================================================================================
| SMILES        | Comment
| `C/C(\F)=C/F` | Invalid SMILES: Both the methyl and fluorine are "down" relative to the first allenal carbon
|=============================================================================================================

It is permissible, but not required, that every atom attached to a double bond be marked.  As
long as at least two neighbor atoms, one on each end of the double bond, is marked, the "up-ness" or
"down-ness" of the unmarked neighbors can be deduced.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="75%",cols="1,3"]
|============================================================================
| SMILES        | Comment
| `F/C(CC)=C/F` | trans-difluoro configuration, position of methyl is implied
|============================================================================

Extended cis and trans configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an odd number
of double bonds:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="50%"]
|==============================================
| SMILES             | Name
| `F/C=C=C=C/F`      | trans-difluorobutatriene
| `F/C=C=C=C\F`      | cis-difluorobutatriene
|==============================================

==== Tetrahedral Allene-like Systems

Extended tetrahedral configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an even number
of double bonds.  The normal tetrahedral rules using `'@'` and `'@@'` apply, but the "neighbor" atoms
to which the chirality refers are at the ends of the allene system.  For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="70%",cols="2,1"]
|============================================================
| Depiction                             | SMILES
| image:depict/tetrahedral-allene.gif[] | `NC(Br)=[C@]=C(O)C`
|============================================================

To determine the correct clockwise or anticlockwise specification, the allene is conceptually
"collapsed" into a single tetrahedral chiral center, and the resulting chirality is marked as a
property of the center atom of the extended allene system.

==== Square Planar Centers

There are three tags to represent square planar stereochemistry: `@SP1`, `@SP2`
and `@SP3`. Since there is no way to determine to what chirality class an atom
belongs based on the SMILES alone, the SP class is not the default class for
tetravalent stereocenters. Therefore are the shorthand notations (`@`, `@@`) not
equivalent to `@SP1` and `@SP2`. That is, the full specification must be there
(`@SP` followed by 1, 2 or 3). The square planar also differs from the other
chiral primitives in that it does not use the notion of (anti-)clockwise.
Instead, each primitive represents a shape that is formed by drawing a line
starting from the atom that is first in the SMILES pattern to the next until
the end atom is reached. This may result in 3 possible shaped which are
referred to by a character with identical shape: `'U'` for `@SP1`, `'4'` for `@SP2` and
`'Z'` for `@SP3`. The graphical from of these shapes is illustrated in the image
below.

image:depict/SPshapes.png[]

*Background:*

_Also note that each shape starts and ends at specific positions. Both U and Z
start from atoms that are successors or predecessors when arranging the atoms
in the plane in anti-clockwise or clockwise order. The start and end atoms for
the Z shape are never adjacent in such an ordering. For each shape there are
4 possible ways to start (and end) drawing the line. Also, for all the drawn
lines, the start and end point can be exchanged. Thus 3 shapes, 4 ways to
start/end and 2 ways to order the atoms for a shape results in 3 * 4 * 2 or
24 combinations. This is the same as the number of permutations that can be
made with 4 numbers (i.e. P(n) = n!). This allows for canonical SMILES
writers to use any ordering to output the atoms._

==== Trigonal Bipyramidal Centers

The chiral atom's neighbors are labeled a, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` in the order that they
are parsed. For example, for `S[As@@](F)(Cl)(Br)N` `S` corresponds to `a`, `F` to `b`, `Cl`
to `c`, `Br` to `d` and `N` to `e`. This order is the unit permutation, represented as the
ordered set `(a, b, c, d, e)`. In the simplest case `@TB1` viewing from a towards `e`,
`(b, c, d)` are anti-clockwise (`@`). Likewise, `@TB2` is specified as viewing from `a`
towards `e`, `(b, c, d)` are ordered clockwise (`@@`). The remaining TB's permute the
axis as indicated in the table below. A final example, for `@TB6` the viewing axis is from
`a` towards `c` and `(b, d, e)` are clockwise (`@@`).

| `F[As@TB15](Cl)(S)(Br)N` | `Br[As@TB20](Cl)(S)(F)N`
|===================================================

*Background:*

_The trigonal Bipyramidal chirality is considerably more complex than any of the
previous classes since the chiral atom has an extra neighbor. This increases the
number of combinations to order the neighbors in a SMILES string from 24
to 120. Since every order of the atoms should be representable by a SMILES
string, the 20 TB primitives suffice for this. In the trigonal bipyramidal
geometry, 3 atoms lie in a plane and the remaining 2 atoms are perpendicular
to this plane and are on the opposite sides of the plane forming an axis. The
anti-clockwise and clockwise refers to the order of the 3 plane atoms when
viewing along the axis in the specified direction. Unlike tetrahedral geometry,
reordering the 3 atoms does not require that the axis be changed. Given an order
of the axis atoms the 3 plane atoms are ordered either anti-clockwise or
clockwise. Although there are P(3) = 3! or 6 possible permutations of 3 numbers,
exchanging a pair inverts the parity and the 6 permutations are therefore
divided in two groups (@, @@) containing 3 permutations each. Because there are
now two atoms that determine the viewing direction along the axis, these atoms
too can be in any of the 5 positions in a permutation. Given the atoms
as the set {a, b, c, d, e}, there are C(5, 2) = 20 possible combinations
of 5 things taken 2 at a time. However, the use of the @ and @@ symbols halve
this to 10. These 10 combinations are the ordered sets (a, e), (a, d) (a, c),
(a, b), (b, e), (b, d), (b, c), (c, e), (c, d) and (d, e). Each of these pairs
correspond to an TB primitive._

==== Octahedral Centers

For 6 atoms, the unit permutation is `(a, b, c ,d ,e ,f)`. `@OH1` means when viewing
from `a` towards `f`, `(b, c, d, e)` are ordered anti-clockwise (`@`). `@OH2` uses the same
axis but the 4 intermediate atoms are ordered clockwise. The interpretation of the 28
remaining numbers is more complex though. The concept of shapes (see square planar
stereochemistry) to describe the orientation of 4 atoms in a plane is reused. However,
this time these shapes also have a clockwise or anti-clockwise winding. For the U shape,
this is trivial since it means that the 4 atoms are listed clockwise or anti-clockwise.
For the Z shape, the connection between the first two atoms determines the winding.
Finally, for the 4 shape, the connection between the second and third atom determines
the winding. The table below lists the shapes, axes and orders.

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

*Background:*

_Octahedral stereochemistry is even more complicated since there is yet another
extra neighboring atom. This raises the number of permutations to P(6) = 720.
There are three axis that can be chosen and the orientation of the remaining
4 atoms has to be described. To describe these 4 atoms, P(4) = 24 permutations
are used together with a shape. An axis always starts from the first neighbor
atom and can end at any of the other neighbor atoms giving rise to 5 axis.
As a result, each OH number encodes the axis positions, a shape and an order.
Since all 3 axis can be placed in this positions, the start/end can be exchanged
and each shape can start from any of the 4 atoms, each number represents
3 * 2 * 4 = 24 of the 720 permutations. Finally, 24 * 30 = 720 so all permutations
can be used to write a canonical SMILES._

==== Partial Stereochemistry

SMILES allows partial stereochemical specifications.  It is permissible for some chiral centers
or double bonds to have stereochemical markings in the SMILES, while others in the same SMILES
string do not.  For example:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="60%",cols="2,1"]
|===========================================================
| SMILES                              | Comment
| `F/C=C/C/C=C\C`                     | completely specified
| `F/C=C/CC=CC`                       | partially specified
| `N1[C@H](Cl)[C@@H](Cl)C(Cl)CC1`     | partially specified
|===========================================================

==== Other Chiral Configurations

The SMILES language supports a number of atom-centered chiral
configurations:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="40%"]
|==============================
| SMILES | Configuration
| `TH`	 | Tetrahedral
| `AL`	 | Allenal
| `SP`   | Square Planar
| `TB`   | Trigonal Bipyramidal
| `OH`   | Octahedral
|==============================

The shorthand notations `'@'` and `'@@'` correspond to anti-clockwise and
clockwise tetrahedral chirality, and are the same a `'@TH1'` and
`'@TH2'`, respectively.  Likewise, in an allenal configuration, the shorthand
notations `'@'` and `'@@'` correspond to `'@AL1'` and `'@AL2'`, respectively.

Very few SMILES systems actually implement the rules for `SP`, `TB` or `OH` chirality.

== Parsing Termination

A SMILES string is terminated by a whitespace terminator character (space, tab, newline,
carriage-return), or by the end of the string.

Other data or information, such as a name, properties, registration number, etc., may follow the
SMILES on a line after the whitespace character.  SMILES parsers will ignore this data, although
applications that use the SMILES parser will often make use of it.

== Programming Practices

OpenSMILES is designed to facilitate exchange of chemical information.  To achieve that goal, it
SMILES parsers should impose as few limits as possible on the language.

There is no formal limit to the length of a SMILES string; SMILES of over 1 million characters
have been assembled for various purposes.  There is no requirement that a SMILES parser must be able
to parse these exceptionally long SMILES, but as a guideline, all implementations of SMILES parsers
should, at a minimum, accept and correctly parse SMILES strings of 100,000 characters.  If a SMILES
parser encounters a string that is too long to parse, it should generate a relevant error
message.

A SMILES parser should accept at least four digits for the <<atomclass,atom class>>,
and the values 0 to 9999.

There is no formal limit to the number of rings a molecule can contain.  There are only
100 ring-closure numbers, but since numbers can be reused, a molecule can potentially have more
than 100 rings.  SMILES parsers should accept and correctly parse molecules with at least 1000 rings;
it is preferable to place no limits on the number of rings a molecule can contain.

Branches (parentheses) can be nested to an arbitrary depth.  Some SMILES strings in standard
databases contain over 30 levels of branches, and much deeper nesting is possible.  A general
purpose parser must handle at least 100 levels; it is preferable to place no limits on nesting
depth for parentheses.

There is no formal limit on the number of bonds an atom can have.  SMILES parsers should allow at
least ten bonds to each atom; it is preferable to place no limits on the number of bonds to each
atom.

There is no limit to the number of "dot-disconnected" fragments in a SMILES.  A SMILES of 100,000
atoms could in principle contain no bonds at all; SMILES parsers should place no limits on the
number of fragments allowed (except that it is limited to the number of atoms the parser can
manage).

Programmers are *strongly* encouraged to provide detailed and clear error messages.  If
possible, the error message should show exactly which character or "phrase" of the SMILES string
triggered the error message.

[[normalization]]

== Writing SMILES: Normalizations

=== What is Normalization?

A wide variety of SMILES strings are acceptable as input.  For example, all of the following
represent ethanol:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="60%",cols="3,1"]
|==============================================
| SMILES                              | Name
| `CCO`                               | ethanol
| `OCC`                               | ethanol
| `C(O)C`                             | ethanol
| `[CH3][CH2][OH]`                    | ethanol
| `[H][C]([H])([H])C([H])([H])[O][H]` | ethanol
|==============================================

However, it is desirable to write SMILES in more standard forms; the first two forms above are
preferred by most chemists, and require fewer bytes to store on a computer. Several levels of
normalization of SMILES are recommended for systems that generate SMILES strings.  Although these are not
mandatory in any sense, they should be considered guidelines for software engineers creating SMILES systems.

=== No Normalization

The simplest "normalization" is no normalization.  SMILES can be written in any form whatsoever,
as long as they meet the rules for SMILES.  Some examples of systems that might produce
un-normalized SMILES are:

* A system that enumerates combinatorial libraries using the rnum/dot-bond technique
  <<inatoms,discussed above>>.  SMILES produced by such a system will typically be a series
  of partial SMILES that are concatenated with dots into a complete molecule.
* Simple pass-through "filters" that don't have a full SMILES writer, but merely copy the input
  SMILES to the output.  An example might be a molecular modeling program that reads SMILES to
  generates logP values, but has no capability to convert its molecular data structures back to a
  SMILES; instead it just copies its input SMILES to its output.

[[standardform]]

=== Standard Form

The "standard form" of a SMILES is designed to produce a compact SMILES,
and one that is human readable (for smaller molecules).

In addition, a normalized SMILES has the important property that it
matches itself as a
https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html[SMARTS]
string.  This is a very important feature of normalized SMILES in
cheminformatics systems.

_Note: In the example below, the "Wrong" SMILES examples are all valid SMILES, but are "wrong"
in the sense that they are not the preferred form for standard normalization._

[[canonicalization]]

=== Canonical SMILES

A _Canonical SMILES_ is one that follows the <<standardform,Standard Form>>
above, and additionally, always writes the atoms and bonds of any particular molecule in
the _exact same order_, regardless of the source of the molecule or its history in the
computer.  Here are a few examples of Canonical versus non-Canonical SMILES:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="50%"]
|==============================================
| Canonical SMILES | Non-canonical  | Name
.2+| `OCC`         | `CCO`       .2+| ethanol
|                    `C\(C)O`
.3+| `Oc1ccccc1`   | `c1ccccc1O` .3+| phenol
|                    `c1(O)ccccc1`
|                    `c1(ccccc1)O`
|==============================================

// The (C) in the SMILES above is escaped as \(C) in order to avoid GitHub from displaying a copyright symbol

The primary use of Canonical SMILES is in
https://www.emolecules.com/info/support-cheminformatics-101.html#/cheminformatics-basics[cheminformatics]
systems.  A molecule's structure, when expressed as a canonical SMILES,
will always yield the same SMILES string, which allows a chemical database
system to:

* Create a unique name (the SMILES) for each molecule in the system
* Consolidate data about one molecule from a variety of sources into a single record
* Given a molecule, find its record in the database

Canonical SMILES should _not_ be considered a universal, global
identifier (such as a permanent name that spans the WWW).  Two
systems that produces a canonical SMILES may use different rules in their
code, or the same system may be improved or have bugs fixed as time passes,
thus changing the SMILES it produces.  A Canonical SMILES is primarily
useful in a single database, or a system of related databases or information,
in which all molecules were created using a single canonicalizer.

The rules (algorithms) by which the canonical ordering of the atoms in a
SMILES are generated are quite complex, and beyond the scope of this
document.  There are many chemistry and mathematical graph-theory
papers describing the canonical labeling of a graph, and writing a
canonical SMILES string.  See the <<appendix,Appendix>> for further
information.

Those considering Canonical SMILES for a database system should also investigate
https://www.inchi-trust.org/[InChI], a canonical naming system for chemicals that is an
approved IUPAC naming convention.

=== SMILES Files

_SMILES file_ consists of zero or more SMILES strings, one per line, optionally followed
by at least one whitespace character (space or tab), and other data.  There can be no leading
whitespace before the SMILES string on a line.  The optional whitespace character and data that
follows it are not part of the SMILES specification, and interpretation of this data is up to
applications that use the SMILES file.  Each line of the file is terminated by either a singe LF
character, or by a CR/LF pair of characters (commonly called the "Unix" and "Windows" line
terminators, respectively).  A SMILES parser must accept either line terminator.  A blank line in
the SMILES file, or a line that begins with a whitespace character, should be completely ignored by
a SMILES parser.

[[nonstandard]]

== Nonstandard Forms of SMILES

Several SMILES-generating systems are in use that either generate
incorrect SMILES, or that interpreted some of the ambiguous features of the
original SMILES specification in different ways.  Although these SMILES are
illegal according to this formal OpenSMILES specification, it is often useful to
parse them, in order to make use of the information that accompanies these
SMILES.

These "relaxed" SMILES rules should only be allowed when the user
(presumably after thinking about the consequences) requests it.  A SMILES
parser that allows any or all of these "relaxed" rules _must
not do it by default_.  The user must specifically request these relaxed
rules before a parser can accept such SMILES.

The following table lists "relaxed" rules that SMILES parsers may
accept.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",width="100%",cols="3,2,3,6"]
|==========================================================================================
| Rule                 | Example         | Interpreted as ...    | Details
.3+| Extra parentheses | `C\(\(C))O` | `C\(C)O` .3+| Extra parentheses are ignored in places where there is no ambiguity as to the meaning.  Note that the form `(CO)N` is never allowed, since it isn't clear which atom the nitrogen should connect to.
|                        `C\(\(C))O` | `C\(C)O`
|                        `(N1CCCC1)` | `N1CCCCC1`
.3+| Misplaced dots | `[Na+]..[Cl-]` | `[Na+].[Cl-]` .3+| Two or more dot-bonds in a row are condensed into one.  A leading or trailing dot-bond is ignored.  Note that a dot that starts a branch is _legal_ in strict SMILES; for example, `C1CC(.[Na+])CC1[O-]` is a legal (though strange) SMILES.
|                     `.CCO` | `CCO`
|                     `CCO.` | `CCO`
| Mismatched Ring Bonds | `C1CCC` | `CCCC` | Mismatched ring bonds are ignored.  Note that this is almost always a bad idea.  For example, `C1CCCCC2` is almost certainly supposed to be cyclohexane `C1CCCCC1`, but with "relaxed" parsing would be interpreted as hexane.
.3+| Invalid Cis/Trans specification | `C/C=C` | `CC=C` .3+| Mismatched or incomplete cis/trans bonds are ignored.
|                                      `C/C=CC` | `CC=CC`
|                                      `CC/=C/C` | `CC=CC`
| Conflicting cis/trans specification | `C/C(\F)=C/C` | `CC(F)=CC` | Conflicting cis/trans bonds are ignored. (In this case, both the methyl and fluorine on the left are shown as _trans_ to the methyl on the right, an impossible configuration.)
.2+| D and T | `D[CH3]` | `[2H][CH3]` .2+| The symbols `D` and `T` are treated as synonyms for `[2H]` and `[3H]`.
|              `T[CH3]` | `[3H][CH3]`
.2+| Lowercase as sp^2^ | `CccccC` | `CC=CC=CC` 2,4-hexadiene .2+| Lowercase letters are interpreted as sp^2^, even outside of ring systems.
|                         `Ccc` | `CC=C` propene

== SMILES Flavors

It is an unfortunately common misconception that a Canonical SMILES does not
contain stereochemistry or alternatively that all SMILES must be canonical. SMILES flavors as described by Daylight are summarised below.

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows",cols="6,3,3,3"]
|===============================================================
| Flavor           | Atoms and Bonds Distinctly Ordered | Stereochemistry | Isotopes
| Canonical SMILES | Y    | Y/N             | Y/N
| Arbitrary SMILES | N    | Y/N             | Y/N
| Isomeric SMILES  | Y/N  | Y               | Y
| Unique SMILES    | Y    | N               | N
| Absolute SMILES  | Y    | Y               | Y
| Generic SMILES   | N    | N               | N
|===============================================================

These terms can be confusing and *should be avoided* due to conflicting definitions between vendors and toolkits. For example ChemAxon use the term *Isomeric SMILES* to mean a non-canonical SMILES with stereochemistry and isotopic information specified (see https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/SMILES[SMILES, ChemAxon Documentation]). OEChem use the term *Isomeric SMILES* to mean a canonical SMILES with stereochemistry and isotopic information specified (see https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/cpp/oechemtk/OEChemFunctions/OECreateIsoSmiString.html[+OECreateIsoSmiString+]), *Absolute SMILES* to mean a non-canonical SMILES with stereochemistry and isotopic information specified (see https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/cpp/oechemtk/OEChemFunctions/OECreateAbsSmiString.html[+OECreateAbsSmiString+]), and *Canonical SMILES* to mean a canonical SMILES *without* stereochemistry and isotopic information specified (see https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/cpp/oechemtk/OEChemFunctions/OECreateCanSmiString.html[+OECreateCanSmiString+]).

In general the properties encoded in a SMILES can be chosen by a program to suit a particular purpose. You may have the option to independently include or omit stereochemistry, isotopes, or atom map/class in a generated SMILES. When referencing a particular SMILES flavor confusion can be avoided by including the toolkit, version, and options used.
