Updated purpose and motivation to reflect IUPAC task group efforts; Added aromatic te; Added support for element symbols through Og, element numbers through [#118], and [#0] as undefined; Clarified Hydrogen Hn, where n is a single digit number 0-9; General formatting for consistency; Clarified atom charge property syntax and added support for repeated symbols up to 15 and a 0 charge; Isotope changes: A 0 isotope is now undefined, leading 0 (e.g., 02) is invalid, and removed D,T symbols; Clarified Wildcard atom section with #0 and more examples.; Removed lowercase as sp2 outside of rings; Reworked and simplified SMILES flavors section into the Canonical SMILES section; Atom class change: no leading 0 allowed; Incorporated Nonstandard forms of SMILES section into main text. These are now considered invalid.; Ring rnum change: no leading 0 allowed and clarified when a conflict arises; Clarified that escaped up/down configurations are invalid; Added that leading spaces in SMILES are invalid; Specified a strict bracket atom order

* Created derivative of OpenSMILES Document, IUPAC SMILES+ Specification
Working Draft.

* Updated formatting of opensmiles asciidoc*
The opensmiles.asciidoc was not rendering correctly in GitHub and Atom asciidoc
preview. So, I fixed a variety of asciidoc syntax issues including: headings,
removing open blocks, and table formatting (they must have symmetric number
of '=' to begin and close tables). I did not make any changes to the
OpenSMILES specification.
